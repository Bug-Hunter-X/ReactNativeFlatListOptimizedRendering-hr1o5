This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that the `renderItem` function is called repeatedly even when the component is not visible on the screen. This leads to performance issues and crashes. The problem might be exacerbated when combined with other features like `onEndReached` or `onEndReachedThreshold`. It may not always be readily apparent with smaller data sets.
